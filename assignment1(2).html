<p>When I first opened this link, I noticed the title “404 Page Not Found”, followed by “The Internet feeds on its own dying dreams”. I then scrolled a bit further and saw the interesting and colorful collage of images. All three things grabbed my attention instantly, making this an interesting read. Speaking of reading, this text was quite easy to follow and not too overwhelming. Normally when we are told to read articles for class, I don’t get too excited, but with Wagner’s text, I found it a quite pleasant read. The writer has easy-to-follow paragraphs and gets straight to the point. I never found myself getting bored like other articles that have writers that ramble on for what feels like an eternity. It was a comfortable read because again, it was not so formal, and it felt like I was listening to a friend going on a tangent about what the web used to be.</p>	 

<p>	Since I wasn’t around to experience the web when it first started, reading Wagners experience with it, painted a picture of what the web was in the early years of it being created. I found myself having to google a couple of phrases that I was not familiar with. One of them being, “Geocities”, upon research, I discovered that Geocities was a web service that hosted other websites. What I found fascinating was that GeoCities allowed its users to create and publish websites with no charge. I found that to be interesting because anyone could create their own space with ease and express their creativity, while also learning to create a website. Another thing I learned about was how people were able to just stumble upon websites while searching for something different. Opening their eyes to something new and exciting but, by having it set up like that, where a user can just stumble upon one of these websites created by someone else, it gives that user a unique experience. Surfing the web back then seemed to be a unique experience, an adventure, never knowing what to expect, what hidden treasure you would come upon along the way.  </p>

<p>The author describes this unique Web, as Web 1.0, it was shown to have a more individualized touch and had many points in which users were able to interact with others and manually do their own thing. In contrast, we have Web 2.0 which is a complex web, with premade websites which have become the norm and uninteresting. Nothing about it seems fun, exciting, and new, it is more so just modern and does not have a since of personality. Web 2.0 takes away that relationship with the users by making it straightforward and not something that one can experiment with. The author then goes to talk about how many websites became mobile apps over time. They expressed how the apps now are very minimalistic and “frankly, fucking boring.” I can agree with this on some level because it does feel as though some websites are all the same, not able to interact with them as much, very generic websites. </p>

	<p>In all, I enjoyed this read, especially hearing someone's perspective on the web who has seen it all. Going forward, considering my career path, I will keep some of what I read here with me to create websites that bring back that spark that it used to have. I hope to bring a new perspective that is equally balanced for all generations of people.  </p>
